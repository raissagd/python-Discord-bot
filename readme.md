# Discord bot using python
![](https://github.com/raissagd/python-Discord-bot/blob/main/screenshot.PNG)

This is just a little bot I made for fun, to practice python and learn new stuff.
Right now, it barely does anything, but I'll add new features along the way!

To run it, I had to invite it to my private server, and then run the main.py file on my machine to start it up.

Right now, it only anwers to Hello, Roll (it hands you a random number from 1 to 6, like a dice) and !help.
